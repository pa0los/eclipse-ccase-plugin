/**
 * Defines a collection that allows objects to be removed in some well-defined
 * order.
 * <p>
 * The removal order can be based on insertion order (eg, a FIFO queue or a LIFO
 * stack), on access order (eg, an LRU cache), on some arbitrary comparator (eg,
 * a priority queue) or on any other well-defined ordering.
 * <p>
 * Note that the removal order is not necessarily the same as the iteration
 * order. A <code>Buffer</code> implementation may have equivalent removal and
 * iteration orders, but this is not required.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not specify any behavior for
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode} methods. It is
 * therefore possible for a <code>Buffer</code> implementation to also also
 * implement {@link java.util.List}, {@link java.util.Set} or {@link Bag}.
