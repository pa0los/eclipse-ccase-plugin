##################### Steps ####################
  
  Use this as a model for working with branches in git.
  
  http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
  
  From develop branch make a release branch:
  
  release-2.2.35
  
  (make sure you do it for both projects).
  
  Working is merged into develop branch and when that is stable we make a merge over to master.
  
  git 

1. Make sure all plug-in and feature projects (clearcase,eclipseccase,eclipseccase.feature,eclipseccase.ui) have a new version in  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.          
  


   
2. Update CHANGELOG.txt in eclipseccase-project.
   New heading stating the new version number.
   Same releasenotes.txt in eclipseccase.feature-project.   


3. 

   Select feature.xml (Overview) under 'Exporting' --> 'Synchronize' --> Copy versions from ...

   Select feature.xml (Overview) under 'Exporting' --> 'Export Wizard'
   
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/full/${feature_id}_${feature_version}.zip"
   (either via File->Export...->Deployable Feature or via feature.xml->Export...)
	
	Example:
	
   ${HOME}/git/eclipse-ccase/net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/full/net.sourceforge.eclipseccase_2.2.0.v201002231900.zip
	
     
 
 Build update site
 =================
 
  
 1. Select site.xml
    
   - New category if the plugin only supports a new version of Eclipse.
   - Add feature in category.
   - Select feature named net.sourceforge.eclipseccase_2.2.0qualifier.zip
   - Build ( otherwise qualifier will not be replaced by a date and time.
   
//FIXME: This has to be updated:
http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseP2Update/article.html#introduction   
   
   
2. check directories for content:
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/full/" 
     -> one zip with features and plugins for each feature
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/features/" 
     -> one feature jar for each feature
   "net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite/plugins/" 
     -> one plugin jar for each plugin
     
3. Testing and install plugin from local site. 
   machine if it works, only upload/deploy a release that works.
   Help --> Install New Software --> Add --> 
   Point to the following directory (git):
   
   ${HOME}/git/eclipse-ccase/net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite
   (it will complain if no site.xml is found).
   Make sure it downloads, installs and uninstalls.
   
   
   Release officially
   ==================
   
   1. This step will deploy plug-in on sourceforge 'file management'-site as well as update site.
      Create a file called "login.properties",same level as
      site-deploy.xml,  with name value parameters;
      user=... ,webuser= ... password=... 
      
      Example:
      user=eraonel
      webuser=eraonel,eclipse-ccase
      password=<password>
       
      Note: webuser is "userid,projectname" as one string. E.g. "eraonel,eclipse-ccase".
    
   	  View 'site-deploy.xml' and make sure that you have correct release of Eclipse to deploy in:
      
      
      Execute 'ant all'
   	
     Check that files have been updated:
   	
     https://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-ccase/files/
   	 File Manangement --> ecllipse-ccase_Eclipse_3.5 --> 
   	
   	 Note: If you have problems with File Management there is always a fallback to use the GUI on website.
     https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=50595
      
     For shell based:  sftp eraonel,eclipse-ccase@web.sourceforge.net
   
 2. TAG all projects. First checkin code.
    Use the following tags with current version ( below is just examples):
    CLEARCASE-JAVA_2_1_4_RELEASE (net.sourceforge.clearcase)
    ECLIPSE-CCASE_2_1_4_RELEASE(net.sourceforge.eclipseccase,net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.ui,
    net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.updatesite,net.sourceforge.eclipseccase.feature).
    
 3. Post to eclipse-ccase-release@lists.sourceforge.net
 	Use content of this release from CHANGELOG.txt ( not the whole since there
 	is a limit on mailing list mail size).
 
 4. Post the same release info to News.   
    
    Good to do "once in a while"
